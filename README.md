# CS360 - Mobile Inventory Application
<b>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?</b>
- The goal of the application was to develop a mobile application that prompts the user for a login, and if there is not a valid login, they can create a login, and access the application. The application itself is an inventory managment app, in which the user can add, delete, and modify a database that tracks the quantity of any item in the database. The application also uses SMS notifications to update the user when quantities reach 0.<br><br>

<b>What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?</b>
- It required a login screen, SMS prompt screen, and database view screen. The screens were basic, showing only the necessary information, and navigate through the screens as the user enters in proper information.<br><br>

<b>How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?</b>
- I tested each part as I added in and developed the code for it. It makes things easy to test as each piece comes together. It makes it easier to develop the total project. It was a small project, but, breaking it up into small chunks makes it easier to read and understand, and if changes are needed, it's easier to locate and figure out what changes need to be made.  <br><br>

<b>Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization.</b>
- The actual appliation design was more difficult than I initially thought. Developing the UI did not come to me easily, and I used a lot of external resources to create my application. It took more and more time to get it in a functional and practical layout. To overcome challenges, I had to learn a lot of different methods, and test until I found one that worked in my specific situation. <br><br>

<b>In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?</b>
- Completing the java code to make the UI work with the databases. It was where I felt the most successful, and the most comfortable. I have mostly written java code, so it felt fairly comfortable to me, especially when compared to using the Android database to write .xml files. <br><br>
