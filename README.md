# CS230 - The Gaming Room Software Design
<b>Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</b>
- The client was a company that developed an Android application called 'Draw It or Lose It'. They wanted a web-based game that can be played on multiple platforms of their current application on Android. <br> <br>

<b>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</b>
- My strongest section was making suggestions based on the research done previously, current technology, and development requirements from the client.<br><br>

<b>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>
- The most helpful part of working through the document is how it breaks everything down into steps, and everything is clear. It helps keep focus on the task and to decide on what tasks are important and which ones don't need time and focus on.<br><br>

<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>
- I would revise the development requirements. I'm not entirely sure I fully understood what the requirements were calling for, and some of my research was a bit outdated. I would improve it by researching more into the development process on each platform, rather than using the platform to host a server.  My research had a bit of opinion without enough evidence to back it, and I would fix that by conducting more research in the development.<br><br>

<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>
- I took the functionality of the game and helped split it up so there would be less wasted time expanding to other platforms, while still keeping the game the same as its Android application. The client is important, and the client is the one who asks for the work to be done, but it is the end-users who are the true clients. If they don't like the software or have problems with it then they won't use it, and the product becomes obsolete. <br><br>

<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>
- To make upgrades and maintenance easier, I concentrated on creating clear documentation and separating the functionality of the game from the game needs.<br><br>
